// Since user management is now handled by Supabase, the mongoose and bcrypt dependencies,
// along with the user schema and model, are no longer needed. This file can be safely removed
// or repurposed for other non-user-related models if necessary. For now, this file will be left
// empty to signify that user management is entirely handled by Supabase's authentication mechanism.
// Remember to remove or update any references to this file in the rest of the project to avoid errors.

// This file is intentionally left blank following the migration to Supabase for user authentication.
